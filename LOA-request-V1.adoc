:toc-title: Table of Contents


_Leave-Of-Absence Request_ is a very straight-forward case to show a sample case management solution done by IBM Business Automation Workflow.

== Case

_Leave-Of-Absence Request_ case enables Employees to create LOA requests, and managers and HR can review it.

In the video:

. Employee _user1_ logs in, adds new LOA request case and logs out.
. Manager _user2_ logs in, reviews case, completes Manager review task and logs out.
. HR _user3_ logs in, reviews case, completes HR review task and logs out.
. Employee _user1_ logs in again and reviews the case.

Follow the steps below to create the LOA Request case shown in the video.

== Prereqs

* CP4BA installed with BAW authoring and Content capabilities.
** Note: CP4BA is assumed to be installed using instructions in here: https://github.com/samisalkosuo/cp4ba-install-helper.

== Create case solution

In this section, we create the solution, add roles, add document class and create properties.

=== Create solution

* Go to CP4BA homepage.
* Click _Design_ -> _Business Automations_.
* Click _Create_ -> _Workflow_ -> _Workflow automation_.
* Check _Include case features_.
* Name: `Leave Of Absence Request`.
* Click _Create_.

=== Create roles

Case management process includes various roles that do the work.

* Open _Leave Of Absence Request_ project.
* Click _Roles_ -> _Add Role_.
* Add following roles:
** `Employee`
** `Manager`
** `HR`
* Remember to click _OK_ and/or _OK All_ when creating roles.

=== Add document class

Create new document that includes LOA request information.

* Click _Documents_ -> _Add Document Class_ -> _New_.
* Enter name: `Leave of Absence Request`.
* Unique identifier is created automatically.
* Click _OK_ to create the class.

=== Create properties

* Click _Data_ to open data page.
* We need couple of choice lists.
* Click _Manage Choice Lists_ -> _Add Choice List_.
* Enter values for the first list:
** Name: `LOA Type`.
** Items (enter name as Display name, Values is automatically the same):
*** `Vacation`
*** `Sick leave`
*** `Unpaid time off`
* Click _OK_.
* Click _Manage Choice Lists_ -> _Add Choice List_.
* Enter values for the second list:
** Name: `LOA Status`.
** Items (enter name as Display name, Values is automatically the same):

* Click _Add Property_ -> _New_.
** Enter name: `Manager comment`.
* Click _Add Property_ -> _New_.
** Enter name: `HR comment`.
** Click _OK All_.

== Create case type

Case types define the activities, the document classes , the activity steps, and the roles that must complete those steps to solve a business problem.

* Click _Case Types_ -> _Add Case Type_.
** Enter name: `Leave Of Absence Request`.
** Identifiers are automatically filled.
** Leave others to defaults.
* Click _Properties_ -> _Add Property_ -> _Existing_ -> _Select all_ -> _OK_.

** Enter name: `HR review`.
* Click _OK All_.

== Test case solution

Now we can test the solution for the first time.

* Save solution (checkmark icon).
* Deploy the solution (next to checkmark icon).
* Start Case Client (far right from the checkmark icon).

=== Create a security configuration

The first time Case Client is started, you'll likely see message like this:

```
You are not a member of a role that is associated with the following solution: Leave Of Absence Request.
```

* Access Case Administration Client:
** Navigate to _CP4BA home page_.
** Click _Business automations_ -> _Workflow_.
* This opens a tiled list of workflow automations.
* Click _Leave Of Absence Request_ tile.
** Click the three dots left of Open-button.
** Click _Advanced_.
* Case administration client is opened.
* Right-click _Leave Of Absence Request_.
* Select _Manage_ -> _Security configuration_.
* Manage Security Configuration tab is opened.
* Select _Create a security configuration_.
* Click _Next_.
* Enter Security manifest name: `LeaveOfAbsenceRequest`.
* Click _Next_.
* Enter permissions for roles:
** Role _Employee_: Create case, View case.
** Role _Manager_: View case, Update case.
** Role _HR_: View case, Update case, Manage case.
* Click _Next_.
** Leave administrators and privileges to default.
* Click _Next_.
* Click row in the table (Employee,Manager or HR).
* Click _Add_ to associate users and groups with selected role.
** Select, for example:
***  _user1_ as Employee.
***  _user2_ as Manager.
***  _user3_ as HR.
*** _dwells_ as all roles.
* Click _Next_.
* Select _Apply the security configuration_.
* Click _Save_.
* Click _Apply_.

Note: there is easier way to add roles while testing by selecting _Leave Of Absence Request_ -> _Manage roles_ in Case client. But security configuration is used in real life production environments.

Access Case client again, using start case icon. Depending on user and role, you can add new case and view cases. But since no activities have been created, nothing can be done.

Case client can also be accessed using URL such as _https://<CP4BA_FQDN>/icn/navigator_.

== Add custom case UIs

Let's modify the case so that we use custom UIs for adding a case and viewing case details. For example, when creating the case Employee-role can only add name and type, and when viewing the case all the fields are read only.

=== Add case UI

* Go to Case type.
* Click _New Add Case layout_ next to _Default layout for Add Case page_.
* Enter name: `Custom New Add Case`.
* Click _OK_.
* Click _Custom New Add Case_ to open layout in Process Designer.
* Diagram view is opened.
* Right-click _Edit Case Properties_ and select _Open_.
* UI desiger is opened.
* Select _Variables_ on the right.
* Scroll to _caseProperties_.
* Drag and drop the following to blueish _Drop content here_ box:
** Employeename
** LOAType
* Click Save (check icon on upper right).
* Go back to Case type.
* Select _Custom New Add Case_ as default layout for Add Case page.
* Click _Save_ and _Deploy_. 

Open Case client and when adding the case you should see only Employee name and LOA Type fields.

== Case details UI

* Go to Case type.
* Click _New Case Details layout_ next to _Default layout for Case Details page_.
* Enter name: `Custom Case Details`.
* Click _OK_.
* Click __Custom Case Details_ to open layout in Process Designer.
* Diagram view is opened.
* Right-click _Case Details_ and select _Open_.
* UI desiger is opened.
* Click _tw.resource.CAT.properties_ in the UI designer.
** Blueish Drop content here box is shown below tabs.
* Select _Variables_ on the right.
* Scroll to _caseProperties_.
* Drag and drop _caseProperties_ to the _Drop content here_ box.
* For each field:
** Click on the name.
** Select _Visibility_ in the pane below.
** Change _Editable_ to _Read only_.
* Optionally: change order of fields by dragging the field.
* Click Save (check icon on upper right).
* Go back to Case type.
* Select _Custom New Add Case_ as default layout for Add Case page.
* Click _Save_ and _Deploy_. 

Open Case client and when viewing properties of an added case, you should note that fields are read only.


== Add Activities

An activity represents a specific operation that is performed as part of a case. 

LOA request case has two activities:

* Manager Review.
* HR Review.

=== Manager review

Let's create _Manager review_ process and UI.

* Go to Case type.
* Click _Activities_ -> _Add Activity_ -> _Activity with New Process_.
* Enter name: `Manager Review`.
* Select _Is required_.
* Click _OK_.
* Activity tile is created.

* Process designer opens, showing process diagram.
* Click on the empty space of _All users_ lane.
* In the _Behavior_ section below, click _Select_ to select users for the lane.
* Select _Manager_.
* Click _Inline user task_.
** Activity properties are displayed below the diagram.
* Change name to: `Manager review`.
* Change type to: _User task_.
* In the Implementation-section, click _New_.
* Enter `Manager review` as the name of new client-side human service.
* Click _Next_.
* Uncheck _activityProperties_.
* Click _Finish_.
** This opens Client-side human service editor, showing Coach-activity (UI) in the middle.
* Right-click the Coach-activity and click _Open_.
** This opens UI designer.
* Select _Variables_ on the right.
* Find _caseProperties_ and drag and drop it to blueish _Drop content here_ box.
* Change Visibility to Read only of following fields:

* Open _Data mapping_-tab.
* Click _Open..._.
* Map _caseProperties_ to _caseProperties_-input by click the field right of the _caseProperties_.
* Click _OK_.

Now we have created UI for Manager review. The next step is to create a script task that completes the _Manager review_-stage.

* Drag and drop a System task (gears-icon) from the right side palette between _Manager review_ and _End_.
* Change name to `Handle Manager review stage`.
* Under _Implementation_, click _New_ to create new Service flow.
* Enter name: `Handle Manager review stage`.
* Click _Finish_.
* Service flow diagram editor opens.
* Click _Variables_-tab.
* Click _+_-icon next to _Input_.
* Enter `loaManagerComment` as name of the new input variable.
* Go back to diagram.
* From the palette on the right, drag and drop _Server script_ activity to diagram (between _Start_ and _End_).
* In the properties below, enter name `Handle Manager review stage`.
* In the _Script_-tab, copy the following:

```
if(tw.local.loaManagerComment != null && tw.local.loaManagerComment != "" ) {
// add a comment to the case
// The "true" input specifies that this action must be performed as an administrator
tw.system.currentProcessInstance.parentCase.addCommentToCase("Manager commented", true);
// complete current stage as the administrator
tw.system.currentProcessInstance.parentCase.completeCurrentStage(true);
}
```

* Close service flow editor.
* Open _Manager review_-process.
* Click _Handle Manager review stage_-system task.
* Select _Data mapping_-tab.
* Click _Open..._.
* Select variable _caseProperties_ -> _Managercomment_ -> _value_.
* Click _OK_.
* Save by clicking Check-icon on upper right.

=== HR review

Let's create _HR review_ process and UI. This is very similar to previous _Manager review_.

* Click _Activities_ -> _Add Activity_ -> _Activity with New Process_.
* Enter name: `HR Review`.
* Select _Is required_.
* Select _Preconditions_-tab.
* Select _A stage has started_-precondition.
* Select _HR review_ as stage.
* Click _OK_.
* Hover the tile, click _Open IBM Process Designer_ icon.
* Process designer opens, showing process diagram.
* Click on the empty space of _All users_ lane.
* In the _Behavior_ section below, click _Select_ to select users for the lane.
* Select _HR_.
* Click _Inline user task_.
** Activity properties are displayed below the diagram.

* Optionally, change order of fields by dragging them.
* Click _OK_-button and change name to `Complete review`.
* Change button color to dark blue.
* Save by clicking Check-icon on upper right.
* Go back to _HR review_ process by closing UI editor by clicking X-icon on upper left.
* Open _Data mapping_-tab.
* Click _Open..._.
* Map _caseProperties_ to _caseProperties_-input by click the field right of the _caseProperties_.
* Click _OK_.

Now we have created UI for HR review. The next step is to create a script task that completes the _HR review_-stage.

* Drag and drop a System task (gears-icon) from the right side palette between _HR review_ and _End_.
* Change name to `Handle HR review stage`.
* Under _Implementation_, click _New_ to create new Service flow.

== Test 

Now we have created activites for Leave Of Absence Request. We also added roles, so our test scenario is like this:

. Employee creates new Leave Of Absence Request.
. Manager comments the request by adding status and comment.
. HR comments the request by adding comment and optionally modifying status.
. Case is completed.

Before testing the solution:

* Go to _Leave Of Absence Request_ Business Automation solution.
* Save and deploy.

Now we can test the solution. This test assumes that _user1_ has Employee role, _user2_ is Manager and _user3_ is HR.

=== Employee

* Open a new browser window and go to https://<CP4BA_FQDN>/icn/navigator/.
* Login as _user1_.
* Click _Add Case_ -> _Leave Of Absence Request_.
* As Employee-role, only name and type should be visible.
* Enter values, and click _Add_ to add case.
* To see the newly created Case, edit search parameters on the left to search by _Added On_ current day and click _Search_ to search.
* You should see a list of cases, also the newly created one.
* Open the case and note that Properties-tab shows read-only values of case properties.
* Additionally, you can view various case details using this default Case Client.

=== Manager

* Open a new browser window and go to https://<CP4BA_FQDN>/icn/navigator/.
* Login as _user2_.
* Note that Manager-role can not add new _Leave Of Absence Request_ case.
* To see the newly created Case, edit search parameters on the left to search by _Added On_ current day and click _Search_ to search.
* You should see a list of cases, also the one created in previous section.
* Open the case and note that Properties-tab shows read-only values of case properties.
* Open _Tasks_-tab to see that there is task waiting for the Manager.
* Open task and note that UI is the one that was created. 
** Employee name and LOA type are read-only.
* Edit values and click _Complete review_.
* Completion closes the UI and, after a moment, _Manager review_-stage is completed and _HR review_-stage starts.
** Browser refresh may be needed.

=== HR

* Open a new browser window and go to https://<CP4BA_FQDN>/icn/navigator/.
* Login as _user3_.
* Note that HR-role can not add new _Leave Of Absence Request_ case.
* To see the newly created Case, edit search parameters on the left to search by _Added On_ current day and click _Search_ to search.
* You should see a list of cases, also the one created in previous section.
* Open the case and note that Properties-tab shows read-only values of case properties.
* Open _Tasks_-tab to see that there is task waiting for the HR.
* Open task and note that UI is the one that was created. 
* Edit values and click _Complete review_.
* Completion closes the UI and, after a moment, _HR review_-stage is completed and case is completed.
** Browser refresh may be needed.

=== Employee

Optionally, login as employee to see that manager and HR comments and to note that case has been closed.

== Conclusion

_Leave-Of-Absence Request_ solution is now finished. While being a simple case, the implementation showed the steps to create case management process and it's activities. 

The finished process serves as a starting for other case management solutions.
